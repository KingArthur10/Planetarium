Compiling nightshade-11.12.1 on Debian Testing:

apt-get install libboost-system-dev libsdl-pango1 libsdl-pango-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-date-time-dev libgraphicsmagick++1-dev libsdl1.2-dev
(You may need other libraries too; this is the what I needed on top of
what I already had.)

On sid, in addition I had to do:
ln -s libboost_system.so.1.49.0 /usr/lib/libboost_system.so
ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libboost_filesystem.so.1.55.0 /usr/lib/libboost_filesystem.so
ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libboost_regex.so.1.54.0 /usr/lib/libboost_regex.so
Curiously, I didn't need this on stretch.

Download fastdb from tarball, from http://www.garret.ru/fastdb.html
Build it: ./configure && make && sudo make install

Build nightshade-11.12.1: ./configure && make && sudo make install

By default, this will install to /usr/local. So you may need
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
to run it.
