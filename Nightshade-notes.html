<h2>A few other notes:</h2>

<h3>Looking back at earth, the moon, etc.</h3>
<p>
The user guide says:
<blockquote>
"At very high altitudes you can look down on your home planet"
</blockquote>
but it doesn't give any hints how to do that, and I (Akkana) can't
seem to get this to work no matter what I try.
If I set the moon to be the home planet, then selecting the moon
doesn't work and seems to confuse nightshade's idea of where it is,
to the point where I usually have to restart to get things right again.

<h3>Running scripts from a local folder</h3>
<p>
Nightshade has no provision to run scripts from a local directory,
e.g. your home directory. The most straightforward way is to copy
them into the system directory under /opt or /usr/local, wherever
Nightshade is installed.
<p>
But from main.cpp:
If ./data/ssystem.ini exists and is readable under the current directory,
then Nightshade will look for scripts (and other data) in ./data/scripts
else it uses /usr/local/share/nightshade/data/scripts/ (or equivalent
in /opt). So if you want it to look in a local directory, make sure
there's a ./data/scripts under the current directory when you start nightshade.
Note: in that case it will ONLY find scripts there, and won't look for
system-installed scripts.
