A few other notes:
Looking back at earth, the moon, etc.

LOOKING DOWN ON A PLANET:
The user guide says:

    "At very high altitudes you can look down on your home planet" 

but it doesn't give any hints how to do that, and I (Akkana) can't
seem to get this to work no matter what I try. If I set the moon to be
the home planet, then selecting the moon doesn't work and seems to
confuse nightshade's idea of where it is, to the point where I usually
have to restart to get things right again.

RUNNING SCRIPTS FROM A LOCAL FOLDER:

Nightshade has no provision to run scripts from a local directory,
e.g. your home directory. The most straightforward way is to copy them
into the system directory under /opt or /usr/local, wherever
Nightshade is installed.

But from main.cpp: If ./data/ssystem.ini exists and is readable under
the current directory, then Nightshade will look for scripts (and
other data) in ./data/scripts else it uses
/usr/local/share/nightshade/data/scripts/ (or equivalent in /opt). So
if you want it to look in a local directory, make sure there's a
./data/scripts under the current directory when you start nightshade.
Note: in that case it will ONLY find scripts there, and won't look for
system-installed scripts. 

CHANGING CONSTELLATION/ASTERISM LINES:

The numbers in constellationship.fab in each sky_cultures directory
are Hipparchus (I think) star numbers. I got this from the source
code (constellation.cpp). So for example, if you look in
star_names.fab you'll see 91262|Vega, and 91262 is one of the
numbers in the Lyr line in constellationship.fab:

Lyr 5  91262 91971 91971 92420 92420 93194 93194 92791 92791 91971

The first number is the number of line segments; then each pair of 
numbers represents one line segment.

If you click on a star in Nightshade it will give you the Hipparchos
number, so you're not limited to named stars.

So, for example, suppose I want to change Lyra's boundaries so that
in addition to the single tail going out to Vega, I want a second
tail going out to epsilon Lyrae. I click on the star where the tail
starts, and find out that's 91971. Then I click on epsilon, and it's
91926. (That's actually epsilon Lyr 2, but either one is close
enough for the purpose of constellation lines.)

So that means I want a new line going from 91971 to 91926.
So I edit /data/sky_cultures/western/constellationship.fab and 
change that Lyr line to:

Lyr 6  91262 91971 91971 92420 92420 93194 93194 92791 92791 91971 91971 91926

The only trick is that western turned out not to be the default sky
culture for me; I think western-color is, but I'm not sure,
nightshade isn't telling me. But if I go to the Language tab in
Configuration I can switch to Western and then I see my new
constellation line.
