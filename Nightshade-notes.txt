A few other notes:
Looking back at earth, the moon, etc.

The user guide says:

    "At very high altitudes you can look down on your home planet" 

but it doesn't give any hints how to do that, and I (Akkana) can't
seem to get this to work no matter what I try. If I set the moon to be
the home planet, then selecting the moon doesn't work and seems to
confuse nightshade's idea of where it is, to the point where I usually
have to restart to get things right again.

Running scripts from a local folder

Nightshade has no provision to run scripts from a local directory,
e.g. your home directory. The most straightforward way is to copy them
into the system directory under /opt or /usr/local, wherever
Nightshade is installed.

But from main.cpp: If ./data/ssystem.ini exists and is readable under
the current directory, then Nightshade will look for scripts (and
other data) in ./data/scripts else it uses
/usr/local/share/nightshade/data/scripts/ (or equivalent in /opt). So
if you want it to look in a local directory, make sure there's a
./data/scripts under the current directory when you start nightshade.
Note: in that case it will ONLY find scripts there, and won't look for
system-installed scripts.
