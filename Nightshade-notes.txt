Nightshade Notes

Compiled by Akkana, Galen, Patricia and other planetarium volunteers.

========= AT THE PLANETARIUM ============================

TO PREPARE A USB STICK FOR THE PLANETARIUM:

Scripts have to be in a folder named "scripts" on the USB stick
for nightshade to see them.

The web control panel has run, stop, pause buttons, which is handy
because you can see whether your script is running or paused (which
you can't tell when you're testing a script at home);
but be VERY CAREFUL of the STOP button, because once you've stopped
a script, it's stopped, and all you can do is restart from the beginning.

========= SCRIPTING NOTES ===============

The sky in the planetarium by default is rotated so people are looking
at the southern sky. If you want to show something in the northern
sky, like Polaris, this helps:
  set heading 180 duration 4
  wait duration 4

auto_move_duration seems to be how long it takes nightshade
to move to center an object while zooming it.
If it's 0, the view will jump instantly to center the object
before zooming.
If it's set to the same as or longer than the zoom duration,
then nightshade will zoom to a random patch of sky
and then later will pan, still zoomed way in, over to the object.
So be sure this is always set to substantially LESS than the zoom time.
Be sure to set it at the beginning of your script.
The default value may be okay on any given computer
but then may turn out to be much longer in the planetarium.

========= NIGHTSHADE ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER ===============

TO RUN A SCRIPT:
    m for menu
    uparrow a few times to get to scripts
    rightarrow
    downarrow to choose a script
    m 

Key bindings while running a script:
    6 To pause/unpause a script
    7 or Ctrl-C to end a script
    K to resume
    L Fast-forward (speed up script)
    J Slow script down

There's no way to tell for sure when your script is running vs. paused,

A few other notes:
Looking back at earth, the moon, etc.

LOOKING DOWN ON A PLANET:
The user guide says:

    "At very high altitudes you can look down on your home planet" 

but it doesn't give any hints how to do that, and I (Akkana) can't
seem to get this to work no matter what I try. If I set the moon to be
the home planet, then selecting the moon doesn't work and seems to
confuse nightshade's idea of where it is, to the point where I usually
have to restart to get things right again.

RUNNING SCRIPTS FROM A LOCAL FOLDER:

Nightshade has no provision to run scripts from a local directory,
e.g. your home directory. The most straightforward way is to copy them
into the system directory under /opt or /usr/local, wherever
Nightshade is installed.

But from main.cpp: If ./data/ssystem.ini exists and is readable under
the current directory, then Nightshade will look for scripts (and
other data) in ./data/scripts else it uses
/usr/local/share/nightshade/data/scripts/ (or equivalent in /opt). So
if you want it to look in a local directory, make sure there's a
./data/scripts under the current directory when you start nightshade.
Note: in that case it will ONLY find scripts there, and won't look for
system-installed scripts. 

CHANGING CONSTELLATION/ASTERISM LINES:

The numbers in constellationship.fab in each sky_cultures directory
are Hipparchus (I think) star numbers. I got this from the source
code (constellation.cpp). So for example, if you look in
star_names.fab you'll see 91262|Vega, and 91262 is one of the
numbers in the Lyr line in constellationship.fab:

Lyr 5  91262 91971 91971 92420 92420 93194 93194 92791 92791 91971

The first number is the number of line segments; then each pair of 
numbers represents one line segment.

If you click on a star in Nightshade it will give you the Hipparchos
number, so you're not limited to named stars.

So, for example, suppose I want to change Lyra's boundaries so that
in addition to the single tail going out to Vega, I want a second
tail going out to epsilon Lyrae. I click on the star where the tail
starts, and find out that's 91971. Then I click on epsilon, and it's
91926. (That's actually epsilon Lyr 2, but either one is close
enough for the purpose of constellation lines.)

So that means I want a new line going from 91971 to 91926.
So I edit /data/sky_cultures/western/constellationship.fab and 
change that Lyr line to:

Lyr 6  91262 91971 91971 92420 92420 93194 93194 92791 92791 91971 91971 91926

The only trick is that western turned out not to be the default sky
culture for me; I think western-color is, but I'm not sure,
nightshade isn't telling me. But if I go to the Language tab in
Configuration I can switch to Western and then I see my new
constellation line.

Unfortunately none of this helps with the planetarium, because we
don't have access to the computer where nightshade is running, so we
can't add files. Hopefully we'll be able to fix this eventually.
